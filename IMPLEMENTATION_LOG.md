# NOMOS Implementation Log

Use this file for meaningful implementation events only.

## Deferred Production Validation

The following are not blockers to functional feature development and should only be performed when explicitly prioritized:

- sustained load/stress/concurrency testing;
- long soak testing;
- production penetration/security testing;
- chaos testing;
- cloud/Pi parity benchmarking;
- sustained Raspberry Pi thermal/OCR throughput benchmarks;
- production deployment/cutover.

### 2026-09-23 — Phase A platform foundation functional
- Infrastructure on HDD only (docker-data, venv, pip/npm cache all under /mnt/jellyfin/Projects/NOMOS).
- NOMOS Docker Compose on distinct ports (pg 5433, redis 6380, minio 9011/9012) to avoid the running demiourgo stack; containers reused from already-pulled images.
- Backend: FastAPI app (app/main.py), routers for auth/matters/documents/sources/jobs, schemas, core (security/tenancy/audit/idempotency), storage (MinIO), AI router capability abstraction.
- Alembic migration `507295a30f2f` (initial full schema); upgrade verified in dev postgres.
- Switched bcrypt to direct library (passlib incompatible with bcrypt>=4.1). rq requires binary redis conns (decode_responses=False).
- Functional acceptance verified and codified in tests/test_platform_e2e.py (3 tests pass):
  tenancy isolation (cross-org 403/404), MinIO document write/read, durable rq job result persistence, migration, source UNKNOWN/PERMISSION_REQUIRED bulk-ingest block, approved source ingest with dedupe + version-on-change, AI capability routing abstraction.
- Seed registry idempotent (SOURCE_REGISTRY_SEED.yaml). CyLaw remains PERMISSION_REQUIRED (no bulk ingestion).


<!-- Add phase start/completion, migrations, architecture decisions, source permission status changes, major model/retrieval decisions, important bugs/blockers, and deliberate deviations here. -->
